# LSBU Formula Student ‚Äì Steering System Design

This repository showcases my contribution as Junior Engineer (Steering) for LSBU‚Äôs Formula Student Team. I focused on material research and CAD-based design using Autodesk Fusion 360 to develop a lightweight, manufacturable steering system.

## üîß Key Contributions
- Conducted informal material research to evaluate lightweight options for steering components.
- Designed key components in Autodesk Fusion 360, including rack mount, coupler, clevis, paddle shifter, and steering wheel column.
- Coordinated team roles based on individual strengths and supported documentation for manufacturing handoff.

## ‚≠ê STAR Summary

**Situation**: As Junior Engineer for LSBU‚Äôs Formula Student team, I was responsible for contributing to the steering subsystem.

**Task**: My goal was to support the design of a lightweight, manufacturable steering system and assist with team coordination.

**Action**: I researched common materials used in student race cars, including aluminum and mild steel, and designed key components using Fusion 360. I collaborated with teammates to align design choices with performance goals and documented our decisions for future iterations.

**Result**: Delivered a clear, manufacturable steering design and strengthened team documentation practices. My work contributed to improved design clarity and team efficiency.

## üìå Notes
This project reflects my hands-on experience in mechanical design and team leadership. It‚Äôs part of my engineering portfolio for UK placement applications.
